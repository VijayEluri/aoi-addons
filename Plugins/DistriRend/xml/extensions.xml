Splits a scene into two files which can be rendered simultaneously on
two PCs. 

Note that this is a trivial "workaround". It'll only work if your FOV is
low enough. Furthermore, you'll have to manually merge the resulting
images. 

This plugin is not suited for doing serious distributed rendering but it
can be useful in some situations.
