An experimental blob modeller. 

It is based on the "Selections" plugin. Just add a bunch of common
spheres to your scene and add those spheres to a selection set. In the
properties of a blob object, you can set the name of your selection set:
The default is "p" for additive spheres and "n" for subtractive sets. 

Currently, it only supports spheres (not ellipsoids or other object
types).
